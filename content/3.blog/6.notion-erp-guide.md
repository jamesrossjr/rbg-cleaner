## Why Traditional ERPs Fall Short for Modern Businesses

Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems have a reputation problem.

They're expensive, complex, and often require months of implementation. For growing businesses, traditional ERPs feel like using a sledgehammer to hang a picture frame.

But here's what we've discovered at **Right Brain Group**: You don't need enterprise-grade complexity to get enterprise-grade results.

Notion, when properly architected, can serve as a complete ERP system that's intuitive, affordable, and perfectly tailored to how your business actually works.

## The Notion ERP Advantage

### ðŸ§  **All-in-One Simplicity**
Instead of juggling multiple tools (CRM + Project Management + Documentation + Reporting), everything lives in one connected system.

### ðŸ”„ **Real-Time Collaboration**
Your entire team works from the same data, with updates happening instantly across all views and dashboards.

### ðŸ“Š **Custom Views for Every Role**
Sales sees their pipeline. Operations sees project status. Leadership sees high-level metrics. Same data, different perspectives.

### ðŸ’° **Fraction of the Cost**
While traditional ERPs cost thousands monthly, a sophisticated Notion ERP typically runs under $100/month for small teams.
